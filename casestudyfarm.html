            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project introduces a scalable hydroponic system specifically designed to cultivate red clover microgreens, a nutrient-dense crop rich in compounds that support menstrual health.

The system targets two critical urban challenges: the limited access to hormone-supporting foods and the growing concern of period poverty. By strategically positioning these vertical farms near women's shelters and food banks, we create direct distribution channels to serve communities with the greatest need.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <h3>Background/Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                As someone navigating the challenges of PCOS and painful menstrual symptoms, my journey to find natural solutions led me to discover the remarkable properties of red clover microgreens. After years of struggling with conventional treatments and their side effects, I began researching traditional herbal remedies and nutritional approaches to hormonal balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The turning point came when I learned about the high concentration of isoflavones in red clover, particularly their role in supporting hormonal equilibrium. These compounds, along with the microgreens' rich profile of iron, magnesium, and B vitamins, directly address the nutritional deficiencies common in PCOS and menstrual disorders. This challenge inspired me to combine my personal health journey with agricultural technology. I developed this vertical farming project to make these powerful, natural remedies accessible to women facing similar struggles, regardless of their economic situation.

            </ol>
           
            <p><strong> Factors Considered: </strong>  In planning our urban microgreens farm, we need to think about three main things. First, can we afford it and make money? This includes setup costs, running expenses, and potential income. Second, how will we grow the microgreens indoors? We need to consider space, lighting, and controlling the growing environment. Lastly, how will we help our community? We must ensure women who need these nutritious greens can easily get them. </p>
            <p><strong>Recommendations: </strong> We recommend implementing a three-tiered solution for our urban microgreens farm. First, let's set up a flexible indoor growing system that can expand as we grow. Second, we'll team up with local women's shelters and food banks to distribute our microgreens, and also offer a subscription service. Finally, we'll use eco-friendly methods like recycling water and using energy-efficient lights. This plan helps us grow nutritious food and get it to women who need it most. </p>
            <p><strong>Rationale for Suggested Actions: </strong> Our recommendations will be backed by real results from our pilot program, showing how well our growing system works and its impact on the community. We'll share stories from women who've benefited from the program, along with data on our growing success and environmental practices. This combination of personal experiences and practical results demonstrates how our urban farm effectively supports women's health through accessible nutrition. </p>




            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                In urban areas like New York City, there's a critical gap in access to foods that specifically support menstrual and hormonal health. The issue extends beyond basic period poverty - it's about the lack of accessible, nutrient-dense foods that can naturally help alleviate menstrual symptoms and support hormonal balance.

Red Clover microgreens specifically address common nutritional deficiencies in women with menstrual health issues by: supporting hormonal balance through phytoestrogens, providing iron to combat menstrual-related anemia, and delivering essential nutrients that help reduce PMS symptoms.

            <h2>Project Analysis</h2>

            <p><strong> Contributing Factors to the Problem:</strong> The main challenges stem from NYC apartment living constraints. Initially planned for a balcony, weather forced relocation indoors, creating competition between living space and growing needs. The limited indoor area, approximately 50 square feet, requires careful balance between maintaining a functional living room while supporting a productive growing system. Additional factors include temperature management, restricted natural light access, and ventilation challenges typical in apartment settings. </p>
            <p><strong> Strengths & Weaknesses of Location:</strong> Our indoor growing space offers both advantages and limitations. Key strengths include climate control, protection from weather extremes, and constant system access. However, significant weaknesses involve limited floor space, shared living area constraints, and restricted natural light. The indoor setting provides stable temperature and reliable power but presents challenges in ventilation and moisture management, requiring creative solutions for optimal growing conditions.  </p>
            <p><strong> What concepts have you learned from Change Food For Good’s Intro to AgTech course apply to your case?:  </strong> The project applies key AgTech principles including space-efficient vertical farming, controlled environment agriculture, and resource optimization. These concepts helped transform typical apartment constraints into opportunities for innovative urban farming, proving that productive agriculture can thrive even in limited indoor spaces. </p>

            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                The most significant obstacle I encountered was adapting my growing system to New York City's spatial constraints. Initially, I planned to establish the microgreens system on my balcony, which offered optimal ventilation and natural light exposure. However, as winter approached and temperatures dropped, I faced a critical decision: either abandon the project or relocate it indoors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Moving the system to my living room presented several unexpected challenges such as limited floor space required complete system redesign and I needed to maintain living space functionality while accommodating growing equipment. The artificial lighting setup also had to be adjusted for living space.
            </p>

            <p>
                This challenge taught me valuable lessons about urban farming adaptability and the importance of flexible system design. It led to innovative solutions for maximizing growing capacity in minimal space, ultimately creating a more efficient and apartment-friendly model that could be replicated by others facing similar space constraints.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                My microgreens project taught me valuable lessons about urban farming adaptability. </p>
            <p> For anyone replicating this system, consider these essential points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start smaller than you think you need - it's easier to scale up than to overwhelm your space</li>
                <li>Indoor growing requires careful balance of temperature, humidity, and air circulation</li>
                <li>Living space functionality must be considered alongside growing needs</li>
                <li>Invest in quality LED grow lights and timers from the start</li>
                <li>Plan for water management and humidity control in shared living spaces</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The biggest takeaways were that successful urban farming doesn't require massive space - just smart design and adaptation. Most importantly, we learned that urban agriculture can thrive in residential spaces when you embrace creative solutions and remain flexible with your original plans.</p>
