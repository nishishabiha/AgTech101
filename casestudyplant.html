            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p> In modern agriculture, early detection of plant diseases is crucial for crop success. Our Plant Health API serves as a bridge between technology and agriculture, providing farm workers with an innovative tool for real-time plant disease identification. This solution emerged from a critical need observed in commercial farming operations where delayed disease detection often results in significant crop losses. By leveraging machine learning and image recognition technology, our API empowers agricultural workers to identify and address plant health issues promptly, ultimately protecting crop yields and improving farm efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
           <p>The inspiration for this project struck during a visit to a cannabis cultivation facility in Upstate New York. Witnessing firsthand how unidentified nutrient deficiencies and diseases impacted crop health, it became clear that a technological solution was needed. The Plant Health API was developed to serve as an accessible, user-friendly tool that puts expert-level plant diagnostics into the hands of farm workers.</p>
          
            <h2>Project Timelime Milestones</h2>
                <li>Initial Development: Creation of API infrastructure and Postman testing environment</li>
                <li>Technical Integration: Implementation of JSON and Axios packages</li>
                <li>API Development: Partnership with web.plant.id for machine learning capabilities</li>
                <li>Testing Phase: Rigorous testing and optimization of the identification system</li>

            <h2>Areas for Improvement:</h2>
                <li>Dependency on image quality for accurate results</li>
                <li>Need for continuous database updates</li>
                <li>Current limitation of 100 API credits</li>

            <h2>Impact and Results</h2>
            The API has exceeded initial expectations by providing:
                <li>Accurate identification of common plant diseases</li>
                <li>Detailed treatment recommendations</li>
                <li>Educational resources for preventive care</li>
                <p>
                Through Change Food for Good's Intro to AgTech Course, we gained invaluable insights into agricultural technology integration and user-focused solution development. This project stands as a testament to how targeted technological solutions can address real-world agricultural challenges. </p>
